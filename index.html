                <p class="question">How do children learn and grow?</p>
                <p class="overview">Child development refers to the process through which children typically grow and develop from birth through adolescence. It involves physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes that occur as children mature.</p>

                        <p>Babies learn to crawl, walk, and explore their environment. They develop basic motor skills and begin to understand language.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Toddlerhood (1-3 years)</strong></h3>
                        <img src="toddler.jpg" alt="Toddlerhood">
                        <p>Toddlers become more independent, learn to speak in sentences, and explore their surroundings through play.</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>Here are three things you don't know about Toddlers.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Imaginative Play:</strong> Toddlers engage heavily in imaginative play, which helps them develop cognitive skills by experimenting with different scenarios.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Rapid Brain Development:</strong> Toddlers' brains grow to about 80% of adult size by age 3. This period is crucial for cognitive development and learning.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Curiosity and Exploration:</strong> Toddlers are tenable to have intense curiousity about their environment, constantly experimenting to learn about how things work and fit together, even if they end up marring things.</li>
                            </ol>

                    <div class="stage" id="preschool">
                        <h3><strong>Preschool (3-5 years)</strong></h3>
                        <img src="preschool.jpg" alt="Pre-school stage">
                        <p>Children develop more complex social skills, such as sharing and taking turns. They also begin to learn basic academic skills like counting and recognizing letters.</p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="stage" id="school-age">
                        <h3><strong>School-age (6-12 years)</strong></h3>
                        <img src="schoolage.jpg">
                        <p>Children refine their motor skills and cognitive abilities. They develop friendships, learn to solve problems independently, and acquire more advanced academic knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Below are three funny facts about children in these age range.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Literal Interpretations:</strong> In this age group, children take language literally. For example, if you tell them "it's raining cats and dogs," they might look outside anticipatin to see animals falling from the sky!</li><br>
                            <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Kids in this age range are notorious for their honesty, sometimes to the point of embarrassment for adults. They have no qualms about pointing out things like someone's weight gain or asking loudly why someone has a big nose. </li><br>
                        </ol>

                <h2>Key Theories in Child Development</h2>

                <div class="theory" id="piaget">
                    <h3>Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development</h3>
                    <p>According to Piaget, children actively construct their understanding of the world through experiences and interactions. They progress through stages of cognitive development, including sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stages.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="theory" id="vygotsky">
                    <h3>Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory</h3>
                    <p>Vygotsky emphasized the role of social interaction and cultural context in child development. He proposed that children learn through social interactions with adults and peers, and their cognitive development is influenced by cultural tools and practices.</p>

                        <p>Teachers can use Piaget's theory to create developmentally appropriate lessons and activities that challenge children's thinking at their current stage of cognitive development.</p>
